# Liquid Propulsion CAN Packet Specification
This repository includes the generated code for the CAN Packet specification being used by our current engine.

## Generating the code
In order to generate the code [`bitproto`](https://bitproto.readthedocs.io/en/latest) must be installed, then you can run:
```sh
./scripts/compile.sh
```
This will generate all the C, Go, and Python Code.
